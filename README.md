# Light Direction Based Motor Control

## What is this?

The Light direction base motor control is a simple arduino sketch and hardware design, which aims at allowing to control something (a sun sail, or whatever) with a very limited range of hardware parts.

## How does it work?

For further information have a look at the documentation and at the Processing visualization. The code of the the visualization is intentionally very verbose and imitates the actual hardware parts.

## Does this really work?

No Warranty!! That said, it should. It worked good enough for what I intended to do. There are some quirks (e.g. the motor doesn't know it's starting position)
